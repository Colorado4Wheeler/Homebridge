Homebridge Buddy
==========

A plugin for the http://indigodomo.com[Indigo] home automation system ()

As the name implies, it's a companion plugin to the Homebridge-Indigo system as well as a fully integrated and self contained version of Homebridge on its own.  This will fully manage the Homebridge-Indigo configuration file as well as dynamically reload Homebridge as needed when Indigo device changes require it.

Additionally this plugin allows you to create Homebridge Wrapper devices to allow you to use your Indigo devices in a Homekit friendly way or even as just a way to have Siri friendly names for the devices you already have.

System Requirements
---------------

This plugin only works under Indigo 7 or greater.  

If using with Homebridge-Indigo then that software must be installed, but note that this program is ENTIRELY self contained if you do not have or do not wish to implement the more technical version of Homebridge-Indigo.

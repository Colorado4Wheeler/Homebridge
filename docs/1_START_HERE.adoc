:hb: Homebridge Indigo

// Need some preamble to get TOC:
{empty}

== Introduction
{plugin} is a plugin for the http://perceptiveautomation.com[Indigo] home automation platform and a companion to the http://forums.indigodomo.com/viewtopic.php?f=191&t=15578[Homebridge Indigo] implementation of Homebridge as well as including a custom built versio of Homebridge (thus eliminating the requirement to have Homebridge-Indigo installed if you so choose).  This plugin allows you to manage the {hb} installation by giving you a graphical interface within Indigo to configure which devices to include, exclude and define as specialty devices (such as doors, windows, etc).

Along with the basic management for {hb}, {plugin} also expands the functionality of {hb} by allowing you to create wrappers and aliases for your Indigo devices where you can either simply rename a devices more suitable for Siri commands or wrap unsupported devices in a way that you can use Siri to control them.

=== System Requirements
{plugin} has been written and optimized for Indigo version 7, earlier versions of Indigo cannot be used for this plugin. 

=== Built In Homebridge Server
{plugin} comes with a specially compiled version of Homebridge and does not require any additional installations or plugins to operate.  If you already have {hb} installed then refer to the next section for information about that.

=== Using with {hb}
If you have already installed {hb} and are using it for your home automation then {plugin} will work with your existing installation.  In fact, {plugin} was first designed as a way to manage {hb} before it evolved into having it's own version of Homebridge included.

=== Support
All support for {plugin} is provided via the {forum} on Indigo's web site.  Please note that this is a companion to Homebridge Indigo, if you have questions about Homebridge or Homebridge Indigo you should post on the http://forums.indigodomo.com/viewforum.php?f=191&sid=2e9e87b22649331c6ff69819cca5519f[Homebridge Indigo Forum] instead.

=== Updates and Changes
The master branch of this GitHub repository is always the latest release version.  If you want to try other versions just change the branch to the version you are interested in and download the plugin from there.

== Configuration
There are two components to {plugin}, an interface to Homebridge and an interface to Indigo and these are configured in seperate areas of the plugin.

* link:IndigoConfiguration.adoc[Indigo Configuration]
* link:HomebridgeConfiguration.adoc[Homebridge Server Device Configuration]

== Configuring {plugin} Devices
* link:ServerDevices.adoc[Native Indigo Devices and Action Groups]
* link:AliasDevice.adoc[Plugin Alias]
* link:ServerDevices.adoc[Plugin Wrapper]

== Troubleshooting {plugin}

Just like any software, {plugin} can have problems - some are programatic bugs that need to be squashed while others are user errors that can easily be fixed.  If you are experiencing problems with {plugin} please check out our link:Troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting Guide] for assistance.

== Additional {plugin} Plugins and Services
At the root of the plugin, {plugin} is meant to only take your Indigo devices and pass them into HomeKit for you to use, however as interesting Homebridge add-ons become available that users request that provide some functionality above and beyond that which Indigo offers via HomeKit then those integrations may make themselves into {plugin} as configurable options.  If any add-in is listed as experimental then it is USE AT YOUR OWN RISK and may be removed in a future version of the plugin if it becomes problematic in any way.

Currently the following additional plugins are available:

* iTunes (experimental)
* link:CameraDevice.adoc[Camera (experimental)]
* Sonos ZonePlayer (experimental)

== Attempted {plugin} Integrations 

These plugins were attempted to be integrated into the core system but have been sunsetted or removed as a result of them being buggy, causing instability in the core package or useless in their current state:

* Weather Underground: the Homebridge implementation of this is both buggy and virtually useless and was added in 1.0.2 and promptly removed when it would cause HBB to crash on loading reguarly

:hb: Homebridge Indigo

[NOTE]
====
You will be unable to add any Wrapper or Alias devices until you have configured your {hb} server device first!

=== Homebridge Configuration
Configuring a {hb} server starts with adding a Homebridge Server device in Indigo.  Once the device is added you have two ways to configure the device to talk to {hb}, locally or remotely.

==== Device Name
Whatever you name this device in Indigo will be how the device is named when you open a HomeKit application on your iOS device.  The default "Homebridge Server" is used in the {hb} documentation but you can call your servers anything you want to easily identify it in HomeKit (i.e., "Main Homebridge", "Downstairs Lighting", etc).

==== Navigating the Server Device Configuration
To change between configuration options use the combobox "Select a list to configure".

==== {hb} Is Installed On The Same Computer as Indigo (List: Server Configuration)

If your {hb} server is on the same computer as Indigo then you simply need to check "Homebridge is on the Indigo server", everything else will be automatically configured for you.

==== {hb} Is Installed On A Different Computer Than Indigo (List: Server Configuration)

Remote Mac IP Address::
The IP address of the computer where {hb} is installed.

User Name::
A valid user that can SSH to the Mac.

Password::
The password for the configured user.

This information is used to start, stop and configure {hb} on the specified server.  When a remote computer is used instead of using the same computer as Indigo then commands are sent via SSH, so the user that you use here must be able to SSH to the {hb} computer.  You can test this by typing the following command and providing your password:

[source]
----
ssh [username]@[ipaddress]
----

==== {hb} HomeKit Configuration (List: Homebridge Configuration)
If you are installing just a single {hb} server device then the defaults are all you need, otherwise you can change some of the parameters in this screen.  Under normal cirumstances (with the exception of showing temperatures in Celsius) you will never need to change these settings.

Edit Homebridge user::
You should never have to change the user unless you have multiple servers (in which case the plugin will change the user automatically anyway) or if you remove {hb} from HomeKit and need to add it again but it doesn't appear on the list of available HomeKit servers to select.  In either case you don't need to change much, just a single character will do the trick, just keep within the rules of ethernet addresses in that you can only use letters A through F and numbers 0 through 9 and, just like ethernet addresses, no two {hb} servers can have the same user name.

Homebridge PIN::
This is only provided to show you what is being saved to {hb}, it cannot be changed - nor does it need to be.  You can have as many servers as you want in your network and use the same PIN to access all of them.

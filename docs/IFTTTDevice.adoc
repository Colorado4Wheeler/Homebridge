[NOTE]
====
This device and integration is currently EXPERIMENTAL and may be removed or changed extensively depending on the results of user testing.

=== Overview

This add-in for {plugin} allows you to trigger If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) actions from HomeKit as if they were a switch device.

=== Creating Your IFTTT Applet

Before you start you should have https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks[set up your IFTTT applet] (previously called recipe) and Webhook (previously called Maker Channel).  Once done you will have the Webhook key required for this plugin.

==== Step 1: Obtain an IFTTT Key

Go to IFTTT website, sign up for an account. At the top click on ‘Search’ and find ‘Maker’ (Update: this is now named 'Webhook'), and then click the ‘Connect’ button to create a Maker (Webhook) channel. Click on the gears icon (Settings) on the top-right of the Maker (Webhook) channel to view your key. Copy this key to OpenSprinkler’s IFTTT key setting.

**Warning:** *clicking on ‘Edit connection’ will cause the key to be replaced. Once replaced, the previous key will be invalid and cannot be recovered!*

==== Step 2: Create an IFTTT Applet

The idea of IFTTT is that you can connect a trigger (this) with an action (that). For example, if the Maker (Webhook) channel receives a message from OpenSprinkler, then send a text message to my phone. These are formally called recipes, and are now called Applets.

At the time of this writing, IFTTT did not allow creating applets using the web interface, and instead required using the mobile app. Since then they have allowed using the web interface to create applets. So the examples below are captured in the IFTTT mobile app, but you can do so the same way in a web browser by logging in to their website.

Install the IFTTT mobile app on your smartphone, log in, and go to the My Applets tab, click on the + icon at the top-right to create a new Applet.

* For trigger service (this), search and select ‘Maker’ (Update: this is now named Webhook). Set sprinkler as the ‘Event Name’ of the web request.
* For action (that), search and select a desired notification method, such as ‘SMS’, or ‘email’. You can shorten the message body suitably, but keep Value1 in the content as the firmware uses this variable to pass notification content. You can modify the message body later to suit your need.

==== Step 3: Select Events:
Go back to the OpenSprinkler app / UI, Edit Options -> Integration -> ‘Configure Events’. The following events are supported:

* Program Start: triggered when a program is scheduled.
* Rain Sensor Update: triggered when rain sensor is enabled and the status changes (or rain delay status changes).
* Flow Sensor Update: triggered when flow sensor is enabled and upon the completion of a program.
* Weather Update: triggered when there is weather update (i.e. water level has changed) or external IP changes.
* Controller Reboot: triggered when the controller is rebooted.
* Station Run: triggered when a station finishes running. (NOTE: this is likely to generate a large number of notifications, so enable this at your own discretion).

**Note:** notifications that are sent too close in time may be dropped. For example, if multiple notifications were sent within a couple of seconds, it’s likely that only the last one will appear while the other messages will be dropped.

=== Setting Up The IFTTT Key In {plugin}

Click on the Plugins Menu -> EPS Homebridge Buddy -> Configure and enter your key into the field labeled "IFTTT Webhooks Key", save when complete.

=== Setting Up The Trigger Device

Start by adding a device in Indigo as you normally would, selecting EPS - Homebridge Buddy as the type and Homebridge IFTTT as the model.

Once you create your IFTTT device the rest is fairly simple.  Provide the accessory a name, this is the accessory that will appear in HomeKit (in our example under IFTTTT) and each button you create will be grouped under this accessory, each button with its own name, these will be the devices in HomeKit that you switch on or off.

You can have as many buttons as you like for EACH IFTTT accessory device and you can create as many IFTTT accessory devices as you like, so feel free to organize however you like.

There are several ways you can configure the IFTTT hooks.  One is to give nothing more than a button name and either an off or an on trigger.  If you provide only one (on OR off, not both) then it's a momentary switch that you tap to execute the webhook and it will instantly turn itself off after execution.  This is handy if you have a quick command you want to issue.

You can also provide an action for off as well as on, they can be different actions like our example here where we turn the system on to quit mail and off to start it back up again.  How did we do this?  We use automator and Dropbox in our webhook (and also geofencing so this is our backup in case geofencing fails) so that our mail rules stop processing while we are gone and ALL of our email shows up as unread in our iPhone mail app.

You can provide delays for each on and off command as well if you need them.  If you leave these fields blank or make them 0 (zero) then there will be no delay and it won't reflect in the configuration for Homebridge.

You can edit any of your buttons by highlighting it and clicking the "Edit" button below, this will edit the button and remove it from the list so you can make your changes and re-add it (the order does not matter).  You can also remove one or more buttons by highlighting them (or shift-clicking them for multiples) and clicking the delete button.

As a final note, there is currently no way to indicate if your IFTTT action is on or off other than  you telling it so via your HomeKit app, this is something for future releases of HBB.

== Troubleshooting {plugin}

As we find issues that you can correct yourself we'll keep this document updated.  Many issues we encounter are one-off and unique to the individual, environment or computer but those that we encounter more regularly will be added here both so you can try to resolve your issues but also as a reference for us to see if there is any way to automatically resolve these issues in the future via the code.

=== General Troubleshooting

While some fixes require very specific instructions, there are a few things that are common among most, if not all, troubleshooting steps.  You should be familiar with these diagnostic tools to help you nail down issues that aren't covered here.

==== Your Indigo Console Window

You may not be familiar with the Indigo event log because it may not have ever been opened, but most of our diagnostic information will log to that window and if you don't open it up you won't see important diagnostic information.  To view the window simply select Window -> Event Log in Indigo, or press Command-8:

==== Plugin Menu Output

When you select the plugin menu option in Indigo and navigate to EPS {plugin} you are given a wide range of options:

image:/docs/images/TroubleshootingPluginMenu.png[]

===== Reload Homebridge

Troubleshoots: Devices not showing in HomeKit, Devices not responding in HomeKit

Selecting this option will prompt you to select which {plugin} server you want to reload or, if you have {hb} installed, your {hb} installation.  Sometimes restarting Homebridge can resolve your issues.

===== Save Homebridge Config and Reload

Troubleshoots: Devices not showing in HomeKit, Devices not responding in HomeKit, {plugin} server not staying started

This option will force the configuration file to be rebuilt and the server to restart.  If you have problems with {plugin} not starting then it may be that your configuration has become corrupted and needs to be reloaded.  This is also handy if you are missing a device because it failed to save the configuration when you last modified it.

===== Show Homebridge Log

Troubleshoots: Any problem with {plugin} or {hb}

This is your single most powerful diagnostic tool because it shows the native Homebridge log file for each server that you are running.  If you have any problem at all then this file will likely reveal what the cause of the problem is and even if you cannot figure it out yourself then posting this log to the forum will likely result in helpful tips from other users.  This will output the entire log to your event window so make sure that you open that to copy and paste the contents.

===== Show Homebridge Configuration

Troubleshoots: Any problem with {plugin} or {hb}

Sometimes it's important to verify that there is nothing strange in your {plugin} configuration, and that is where this diagnostic tool comes in handy.  Again, this will output to your event log window.

===== Show Support Information

Troubleshoots: Any problem with {plugin} or {hb}

This should be a screenshot or copy-and-paste that you add to any request for support as it will let us know what version of the plugin and libraries you are running, it may be as simple as requesting that you update your installation to a newer version.

image:/docs/images/TroubleshootingEventWindow.png[]


===== Support Data Dump

Troubleshoots: Device specific issues where a device either doesn't appear or it doesn't do what you expect it to do when you use it with HomeKit

There won't be as much need for this unless you have device specific issues as this is a full data dump of all devices currently being used with {plugin} and all of their relevant parameters.  For ease of reading you should clear your log window BEFORE you do this dump so you can copy and paste the entire contents of the window as it will be a significant amount of data.

===== Support Comprehensive Data Dump

Troubleshoots: Device specific issues where a device either doesn't appear or it doesn't do what you expect it to do when you use it with HomeKit or when there is an issue that we are simply unable to find any resolution to

There won't be as much need for this unless you have device specific issues as this is a full data dump of all devices currently being used with {plugin} and all of their relevant parameters as well as every saved state and plugin preference.  For ease of reading you should clear your log window BEFORE you do this dump so you can copy and paste the entire contents of the window as it will be a significant amount of data.


==== Terminal Diagnostics

These processes are significantly more technical and require that you maneuver around the terminal shell to do some digging.

This area is still under construction.

===== Checking The Running {hb} or {plugin} Servers

Executing a simple 'ps ax' will let us know how many Homebridge servers are running and what their PID is, this is handy if we know that Indigo is configured for, say, two servers but only one process shows up here.

image:/docs/images/TroubleshootingPSAX.png[]

===== Getting To The {plugin} Homebridge Configuration and Log Folder

To start you need to first change to the following path, using quotes as indicated:

cd "/Library/Application Support/Perceptive Automation/Indigo 7/Plugins/EPS Homebridge.indigoPlugin/Contents/Server Plugin/bin/hb/homebridge"

You can see from here that you are in the heart of the Homebridge distribution for {plugin}:

```

```

You are in dangerous territory, any changes made here or scripts executed can have serious consequences on your HomeKit.  You'll notice one or more folders that are numbered, these numbers correspond to the Indigo device ID of each server that you have added and inside of each folder are the particulars for that server, including the log file, configuration file and plugin links.

Notice that you have many generations of logs inside your server folders, so you can go back fairly far to see the history of what's been happening.

There are a few things to know about this folder as far as troubleshooting goes:

* No Log Files: {plugin} servers have never started, it could be a corrupt installation of {plugin} and you should probably delete the plugin, download the latest version and reinstall it
* No Config Files: {plugin} was unable to write to your folder, perhaps because of security on your Mac, you should probably delete the plugin, download the latest version and reinstall it
* You are missing the com.webdeck.homebridge.XXXX.plist file: This is the file required to start and stop your server, if it's not present then you may have a corrupt installation

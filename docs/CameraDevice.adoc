:hb: Homebridge Indigo

link:1_START_HERE.adoc[<< Return To Main Documentation]

[NOTE]
====
This device is ONLY valid on a CUSTOM {hb} installation and is NOT incorporated into the base {plugin} package.  If you want to use this plugin then follow the directions provided by Webdeck for installing {hb}.
====

=== Overview
This add-in for {hb} allows you to view some camera feeds directly in any HomeKit enabled application just as it were a device.  From the main HomeKit (or compatible) application you will see a still image of the camera as a reference and tapping on the image will allow you to view the real-time video.  This requires that your camera supports JPG still and an RTSP video source.

=== System Requirements
You MUST have the following installed and fully operational before the camera device will work:

* {hb} NOT simply the {plugin} version of Homebridge
* ffmpeg
* Homebridge-Camera

==== Setting up the device
Start by adding a device in Indigo as you normally would, selecting EPS - Homebridge Buddy as the type and Homebridge Camera as the model.

Now click Edit Device Settings to configure your parameters.

When you select which Homebridge server will be hosting this camera you will notice that the only choices you have are for any {hb} servers you have configured and not any {plugin} built-in servers, this is by design as you can only add cameras to {hb} servers because of the requirement of ffmpeg and Homebridge-Camera.  Select your server and give your camera a meaningful name.

From this point you will need to do some poking around on Google to find the parameters you need for your camera, such as the video URL and still URL.  When editing the video and still sources, only change the camera IP address and optional filename, for now you will need to leave the -re -i rtsp:// and the -i http:// portions of these lines to ensure the encoding happens properly.  In future releases these may be incorporated but for now they are left to your preferences.

Save your device and give it a meaningful name.  Once you save your device you should notice a console log message indicating that the configuration has been saved and that {hb} is restarting, if not you can do this manually via the menu.

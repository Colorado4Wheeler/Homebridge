== Introduction
{plugin} is a plugin for the {indigo} home automation platform and a companion to the {hb} implementation of Homebridge.  This plugin allows you to manage the {hb} installation by giving you a graphical interface within {indigo} to configure which devices to include, exclude and define as specialty devices (such as doors, windows, etc).

Along with the basic management for {hb}, {plugin} also expands the functionality of {hb} by allowing you to create wrappers and aliases for your {indigo} devices where you can either simply rename a devices more suitable for Siri commands or wrap unsupported devices in a way that you can use Siri to control them.

=== System Requirements
{plugin} has been written and optimized for {indigo} version 7, earlier versions of {indigo} cannot be used for this plugin.

=== Support
All support for {plugin} is provided via the {forum} on {indigo}'s web site.

=== Updates and Changes
The master branch of this GitHub repository is always the latest release version.  If you want to try other versions just change the branch to the version you are interested in and download the plugin from there.

== Configuration
There are two components to {hb}, an interface to Homebridge and an interface to Indigo and these are configured in seperate areas of the plugin.

=== Indigo Configuration
The connection to {indigo} is configured throught the plugin configuration (Plugins->EPS Homebridge Buddy->Configure).

{plugin} is a plugin for the http://perceptiveautomation.com[Indigo] home automation platform and a companion to the http://forums.indigodomo.com/viewtopic.php?f=191&t=15578[Homebridge Indigo] implementation of Homebridge.  This plugin allows you to manage the {hb} installation by giving you a graphical interface within {indigo} to configure which devices to include, exclude and define as specialty devices (such as doors, windows, etc).

Along with the basic management for {hb}, {plugin} also expands the functionality of {hb} by allowing you to create wrappers and aliases for your {indigo} devices where you can either simply rename a devices more suitable for Siri commands or wrap unsupported devices in a way that you can use Siri to control them.

=== System Requirements

=== Updates and Changes

== Configuration
There are two components to {hb}, an interface to Homebridge and an interface to Indigo and these are configured in seperate areas of the plugin.

=== Indigo Configuration
The connection to Indigo is configured throught the plugin configuration (Plugins->EPS Homebridge Buddy->Configure).
